The clubâ€™s membership committee needs access to certain club-related data in order to perform their jobs. The
"membership module" of the **membertility** system is designed to provide access to this data.

Club Members view
====================
The Club Members view can be used to view or download club member records. There are filters available to view a
subset of the member records.

To show the members as of a particular date, set the Start To date, and the End From date to the date of interest,
and leave the other fields blank.

To show a subset of recent members, set From and To of the End filter.

To download the filtered spreadsheet of members, click the **CSV** button.

.. note::
    The Club Membership view shows the earliest start date and the latest end date for a club member, regardless
    of any gaps in their membership.

    Data collected for this view only goes back as far as when the club started using RunSignUp
    for membership management. This may be improved in a future release.

The view has the following filters:

    :Start:
        chooses range of membership start dates to show

    :End:
        chooses range of membership end dates to show

    :Levels:
        chooses membership levels to show
