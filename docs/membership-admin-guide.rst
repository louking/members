Membership Admin Guide
===========================================

The clubâ€™s membership committee needs access to certain club-related data in order to perform their jobs. The
"membership module" of the **membertility** system is designed to provide access to this data.

.. _Club Members view:

Club Members view
====================

The Club Members view can be used to view or download club member records. Separate club member records are 
maintained for contiguous membership records (see :ref:`Memberships view`).

To show the members as of a particular date, set the **As Of** date.

To download the filtered spreadsheet of members, click the **CSV** button.

.. note::
    To download all of the members with the **CSV** button, you need to set **Show** to *all*.

The view has the following filters:

    :As Of:

.. _Memberships view:

Memberships view
====================

The Memberships view can be used to view or download membership records. A membership record is created by the registration provider 
(e.g., RunSignUp) each time a member renews their membership. This is typically every year, but there are also multiyear memberships 
available. This view shows these individual memberships.

To download the filtered spreadsheet of memberships, click the **CSV** button.

.. note::
    To download all of the memberships with the **CSV** button, you need to set **Show** to *all*. This can take a while to
    load.
