order to perform their jobs. The "membership module" of the **membertility**
system is designed to provide access to this data.

Facebook Group Member Management
--------------------------------------
Sometimes, when determining if a Facebook user is a :term:`member` of the club, it's
difficult because their Facebook name isn't the same as their real name
(assumedly the name they joined the club under). The :ref:`Facebook Aliases
view` allows the :term:`membership admin` to record the Facebook name used by a
member.

The :ref:`Club Members view` shows the members as of a given date, showing their
name as well as their Facebook alias. This allows the :term:`membership admin`
to search for a Facebook name to determine if the Facebook user is indeed a
:term:`member` of the club.
