Task Checklist view
====================

The interface :term:`members <member>` manage their tasks is through the Task Checklist View. If you don't
see **Task Checklist** in the menu on the left, make sure **Interest** is set correctly at the top of the view.

:term:`Tasks <task>` are marked with their *status*, *expiration date*, and when *last completed*.

The :term:`status` tells you whether the :term:`task` needs to be completed now (*overdue*), is coming up
(*expires soon*), is completed (*up to date* or *done*), or if the task is optional (*optional*).

When you select a :term:`task` and then click **View Task**, a window will open. Some tasks may have one or more
fields which need to be filled in, but many just give instructions (e.g., to read a particular document). Once you have
completed the instructions and filled in any required fields, click **Mark Complete** to tell the system you've
completed the task.

.. note::
    If you are marking a :term:`task` completed which was previously completed and had additional
    :term:`fields <field>`, the last :term:`field` entry(ies) you made will be shown when opening
    the :term:`task`.

.. note::
    Some additional date :term:`fields <field>` have been configured to override the Last Completed date, e.g.,
    the Safe Sport Completion Date in the example below

Set Your Password
====================

When your account is first created, you will receive an email to set your password. This email will have
a link you need to click on in order to initially set your password. If you don't click on this link
within 48 hours from the time the email was sent, the link will expire. If that happens, simply go to
https://members.loutilities.com/admin, and at the login view click **Forgot password**. A new email will be
sent to you which contains a new link to click on.

Please choose a password you don't use on other sites, and make sure there are letters, numbers, punctuation,
i.e., that this is a strong password.
