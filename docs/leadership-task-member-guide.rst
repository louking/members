Set Your Password
====================

When your account is first created, you will receive an email to set your password. This email will have
a link you need to click on in order to initially set your password. If you don't click on this link
in 48 hours the link will expire. If that happens, simply go to https://members.loutilities.com/admin,
and click **Forgot password**. A new link will be generated and the email with that link will be sent to you.

Please choose a password you don't use on other sites, and make sure there are letters, numbers, punctuation,
i.e., that this is a strong password.

Task Checklist
====================

The interface :term:`members <member>` manage their tasks is through the Task Checklist View. If you don't
see **Task Checklist** in the menu on the left, make sure **Interest** is set correctly at the top of the view.

:term:`Tasks <task>` are marked with their *status*, *expiration date*, and when *last completed*.

The :term:`status` tells you whether the :term:`task` needs to be completed now (*overdue*), is coming up
(*expires soon*), is completed (*up to date* or *done*), or if the task is optional (*optional*).

When you select a :term:`task` and then **View Task**, a window will open. Some tasks may have one or more
fields which need to be filled in. Once you have completed the instructions (e.g., to read a particular
document) and filled in any fields, click **Mark Complete** to tell the system you've completed the task.
