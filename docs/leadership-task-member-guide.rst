Leadership Task Member Guide
===========================================

:term:`Members <member>` of a club’s leadership team are required to complete various :term:`tasks <task>` in
support of the on-boarding process. E.g., the member needs to gain access to the club's documents, read certain
policies, complete training courses, etc. Some of these :term:`tasks <task>` need to be renewed periodically. The
"leadership task module" of the **membertility** system is designed to define these :term:`tasks <task>` and
track the :term:`members' <member>` completion records.

This guide describes how a :term:`member` manages their :term:`task` checklist.

Task Checklist view
====================

The interface :term:`members <member>` manage their tasks is through the Task Checklist View. If you don't
see **Your Tasks** in the menu on the left, make sure **Interest** is set correctly at the top of the view.

:term:`Tasks <task>` are marked with their *status*, *expiration date*, and when *last completed*.

The :term:`status` tells you whether the :term:`task` needs to be completed now (*overdue*), is coming up
(*expires soon*), is completed (*up to date* or *done*), or if the task is optional (*optional*).

When you select a :term:`task` and then click **View Task**, a window will open. Some tasks may have one or more
fields which need to be filled in, but many just give instructions (e.g., to read a particular document). Once you have
completed the instructions and filled in any required fields, click **Mark Complete** to tell the system you've
completed the task.

.. note::
    When you click on a document link, Google may tell you
    **you don’t have permission to access the document, or to verify it’s you and log in again** -- if this happens,
    you need to click on “Switch accounts” or otherwise log in to
    the correct account to access the document. In some cases, you may need to "switch accounts" more
    than once - and the option to switch accounts may only be offered if you click on your personal email link on the
    access denied screen. Please do not click on “Request Access”, as this will send a request to allow access from your
    personal gmail account.

.. note::
    If you are marking a :term:`task` completed which was previously completed and had additional
    :term:`fields <field>`, the last :term:`field` entry(ies) you made will be shown when opening
    the :term:`task`.

.. note::
    Some additional date :term:`fields <field>` have been configured to override the Last Completed date, e.g.,
    the Safe Sport Completion Date in the example below

Set Your Password
====================

When your account is first created, you will receive an email to set your password. This email will have
a link you need to click on in order to initially set your password. If you don't click on this link
within 48 hours from the time the email was sent, the link will expire. If that happens, simply go to
https://members.loutilities.com/admin, and at the login view click **Forgot password**. A new email will be
sent to you which contains a new link to click on.

Please choose a password you don't use on other sites, and make sure there are letters, numbers, punctuation,
i.e., that this is a strong password.
