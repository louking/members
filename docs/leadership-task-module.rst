Leadership Task Module
===========================================
:term:`Members <member>` of a clubâ€™s leadership team are required to complete various :term:`tasks <task>` in
support of the on-boarding process. E.g., the member needs to gain access to the club's documents, read certain
policies, complete training courses, etc. Some of these :term:`tasks <task>` need to be renewed periodically. The
"leadership task module" of the **membertility** system is designed to define these :term:`tasks <task>` and
track the :term:`members' <member>` completion records.
