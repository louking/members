Organization Admin Guide
===========================================

This guide describes the concepts of the membertility Organization Module.

Positions
==============
:term:`positions <position>` are assigned to :term:`members <member>` for a variety of purposes. **membertility** tracks who is
currently in each position, which is used by the Meetings Module, Leadership Task Module, etc.

To facilitate assignment of sets of :term:`task groups <task group>` to individual :term:`members <member>`,
:term:`task groups <task group>` may be assigned to one or more :term:`positions <position>`, and in turn
:term:`members <member>` are assigned one or more :term:`positions <position>`.
